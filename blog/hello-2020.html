                <h1>Hello, 2020</h1>
                <h2>05 January 2020</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first personal blog post, and a step towards becoming more socially active and allowing people to find out what I'm up to.
                    I typically isolate myself from others, which I believe is a major factor limiting my potential to be my best self.
                    I don't have many close relationships and am terrible at retaining important information.
                    However, many people have helped me and taught me a lot, and I would never be able to thank them enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year I am challenging myself to break free from my comfort zone and do things that I wouldn't imagine myself doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't have a plan or set of goals to achieve.
                    All I know is that people will request me to accomplish tasks, and I will do my best to fulfill those requests.
                    At the same time, I will be constantly working on improving myself and sharing my journey.
                    I'm not alone.
                    People all over the world are overcoming their own challenges, and I also have an opportunity to help others achieve their goals.
                    It's the start of a new year.
                    A new decade.
                    We don't have to change, but now is the best time to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for reading.
