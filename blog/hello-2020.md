This is my first personal blog post, and a step towards becoming more socially active and allowing people to find out what I'm up to.
I typically isolate myself from others, which I believe is a major factor limiting my potential to be my best self.
I don't have many close relationships and am terrible at retaining important information.
However, many people have helped me and taught me a lot, and I would never be able to thank them enough.

This year I am challenging myself to break free from my comfort zone and do things that I wouldn't imagine myself doing.

I don't have a plan or set of goals to achieve.
All I know is that people will request me to accomplish tasks, and I will do my best to fulfill those requests.
At the same time, I will be constantly working on improving myself and sharing my journey.
I'm not alone.
People all over the world are overcoming their own challenges, and I also have an opportunity to help others achieve their goals.
It's the start of a new year.
A new decade.
We don't have to change, but now is the best time to do so.

Thanks for reading.
