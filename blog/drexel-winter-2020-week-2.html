                        It felt like the past week went by quick and I got the most work done over the weekend.
                        Lectures were mostly uneventful as per usual, aside from Japanese since we ran many practice drills for the core conversation skills.
                        I had two assignments due on Friday which were pretty straightforward, although it helped that I had started them early.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for project work, for Board & Shield I revisited my camera script to smooth out the transition to aerial view for going off ramps.
                        I also have been in the process of implementing a multiplayer solution for Cow-Duction and have a half-functioning demo with no UI elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems like I won't have as much time as I would like to write these personal blog posts, so I'll be keeping them short from now on.
                        It's probably a better idea to have more of a presence on more mainstream platforms, anyways.
                        Until next time.
                    </p>
