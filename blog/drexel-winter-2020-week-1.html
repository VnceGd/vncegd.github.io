                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first week felt busy, but it also seemed like I didn't make much progress on some important tasks.
                        I still need to find the right balance for how much time I spend on each class, as well as my personal development.
                        <br>
                        One major mistake I made this week was not working on Cow-duction (for GMAP 378).
                        Since it's a project that is carrying over from last term, we should have made the necessary preparations to hit the ground running.
                        Now that I am the Technical Director, I should be handling more responsibility and guiding the rest of the team on the technical side of development.
                        It's still early in the term, but the sooner I can get into a quick and efficient process for experimentation and iteration, the better.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Class Recap</h3>
                    <p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>(JAPN 101) Japanese I</i> -
                            Seems like a fun class so far.
                            Mostly focused on speaking, starting out by learning some verbs and katakana.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>(CI 492) Senior Project II</i> -
                            Had a brief meeting to go over deliverables for the term.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>(CS 432) Interactive Computer Graphics</i> -
                            Covered a rough history of computer graphics.
                            Got a head start on the assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>(GMAP 378) Game Development: Workshop II</i> -
                            Broke down key areas to focus on moving forward.
                            Multiplayer is important to get done as early as possible.
                            Also discussed ways of reducing the time between iterations (solving the wrong problem analogy).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>(CS 435) Computational Photography</i> -
                            Getting started with MATLAB, a bit confusing but I've been experimenting with some of the example code shown in the lecture slides.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            Practiced the ten core conversations to be memorized by Jan 22.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
