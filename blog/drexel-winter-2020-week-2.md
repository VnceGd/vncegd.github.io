It felt like the past week went by quick and I got the most work done over the weekend.
Lectures were mostly uneventful as per usual, aside from Japanese since we ran many practice drills for the core conversation skills.
I had two assignments due on Friday which were pretty straightforward, although it helped that I had started them early.

As for project work, for Board & Shield I revisited my camera script to smooth out the transition to aerial view for going off ramps.
I also have been in the process of implementing a multiplayer solution for Cow-Duction and have a half-functioning demo with no UI elements.

It seems like I won't have as much time as I would like to write these personal blog posts, so I'll be keeping them short from now on.
It's probably a better idea to have more of a presence on more mainstream platforms, anyways.
Until next time.
